# automate_the_boring_stuff

A collection of my attempt to solve for Automate The Boring Stuff exercises

Automate The Boring Stuff With Python is a book written by Al Sweigart. It can be found online at https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ or you can make a donation and/or purchase the book at https://nostarch.com/automatestuff or Amazon.


I have also filled my codes with a lot of comments. I tried my best to explain what is happening and why I did something. I didn't go into that much detail about explaining how the code works since the book does that. But putting everything together may make it easier. If you were to actually publish code like this most of the comments should be removed.

Last, I am not a professional programmer. I'm only now starting to teach myself so I apologize for any mistakes I have made. Kindly leave me with comments/suggestions on anything you see here.
