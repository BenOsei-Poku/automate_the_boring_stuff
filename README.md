# automate_the_boring_stuff

A collection of my attempt to solve for Automate The Boring Stuff exercises

I tried my best to explain what is happening and why I did something. I didn't go into that much detail about explaining how the code works since the book does that. But putting everything together may make it easier. If you were to actually publish code like this most of the comments should be removed.

Last, I am not a professional programmer. I'm only now starting to teach myself so I apologize for any mistakes I have made. Kindly leave me with comments/suggestions on anything you see here.
